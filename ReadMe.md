> `Overnight` is a hotel booking site, designed to find the best deals and the hottest stays!

 OverNight was developed with the hopes that we could complete the project within a month and a half, however; we quickly learned it would take much longer. fully implementing end to end hotel booking is not difficult to programme, however; it is heighly difficult to aquire access to most APIs that allow booking. All hotle booking APIs that we encountered requried partner programs to gain access to use which greatly slowed down development time. If you are concidering building a hotel booking application know that you most likly need already established company.

The development of OverNight was initially planned to be completed within one and a half months. However, we soon realized that the project would require significantly more time. While programming a complete end-to-end hotel booking system isn't inherently challenging, gaining access to the necessary APIs proved to be a major hurdle. Most hotel booking APIs are accessible only through partner programs, which substantially delayed our development process. For those considering building a hotel booking application, it's important to understand that access to these APIs typically requires an already established company.

# UserGuide

OverNight is currently still in progress and not yet hosted. We have not obtained access to sufficient API calls to publicly host the site without running out of data access. If you would like to see a demonstration of the site, you can visit [here]() to view the developers presenting OverNight in its current state. Alternatively, if you would like to learn more, you can reach out to either of the developers, [Franco Lepe]() or [Reed Broadhead](), for a live demonstration of OverNight or to gain temporary access to the site.

> Current live features
- City Search: Users can search for hotels by city name.
- City Search Filter: Users can filter the search by dates and the number of rooms.
- Secure Link Outs: As booking on site is still in development, when a user goes to book a room, they are linked directly to the hotel's website they are trying to book.
- Accounts: Users can create and log into accounts. This feature is required for the booking feature. However, since booking is not yet available, having an OverNight account does not change the user experience of using OverNight.

>Features in current development

- Booking: Allows users to book on OverNight.
- Email Verification: Ensures user booking security.
- Hotel Search: Enables users to search for specific hotels.

# Development 


>OverNight was created and developed by [Reed Broadhead]() and [Franco Lepe](), however; OverNight would not be the same without all the contributers that helped make this possible.

## Development Processes

> The Backend
---
- The backend was developed with Express.js, the prisma ORM, and a PostgreSQL database. 

- We used an API called HotelBeds to gain access to hotel data, then stored that data in our own relational database. We thought this process of data transference was strange; however, that is what HotelBeds required us to do.

- The development of OverNight was initially planned to be completed within one and a half months. However, we soon realized that the project would require significantly more time. While programming a complete end-to-end hotel booking system isn't inherently challenging, gaining access to the necessary APIs proved to be a major hurdle. Most hotel booking APIs are accessible only through partner programs, which substantially delayed our development process.

> Front end 

---

- We built the Front-end with React, Tailwind , and Redux.

- A large portion of building the front-end for OverNight involved working with a UX/UI consultant. We were already halfway done with the site when we enlisted the help of [Aydan Rivera](). So, when she provided us with the redesign for OverNight, we had to remake certain sections of the site and figure out how best to implement the mockups. This extended the time it took us to build OverNight; however, it greatly enhanced the look and feel of the site.

---

Overall, building OverNight was a long but rewarding experience that has resulted in a project of which we can truly be proud.

OverNight was build by [Reed Broadhead]() and [Franco Lepe]().
